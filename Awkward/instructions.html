      <b>How to Play:</b>
      <br/>
      Gather 3-6 of your most awkward friends and strangers.
      Elect one person as the “Card Reader”.
      All other players are “Card Players”.
      “Card Reader” reads the #AwkwardSituation to the group.
      One by one, “Card Players” say, act, and/or sing their reaction(s) to the #AwkwardSituation
      Each “Card Player” has 10 seconds to react.
      If a “Card Player” gives no reaction, he/she loses (1) point
      If “Card Player” has no points, nothing happens
      When all “Card Players” have reacted, the “Card Reader” gives (1) point to the “Card Player” with the best reaction.
      This is considered a “Round”.
      Whoever wins a “Round” becomes the “Card Reader” for the next “Round”
      Repeat steps 3a - 3e until one “Card Player” has (3) points. He/She wins the game.
